# spAts Web Tasks

This is a repo containing the various tesks I do for the [spAts](https://www.facebook.com/spAts.iitkgp/) webD team. Nothing too amazing to see here, just some small pages we make for practice purposes. The front page currently has no styling and is just a bunch of links, will work on that later, if I don't forget about it and don't get lazy that is.

**Note:** Haven't added media query to of the webpages, so stick to opening on desktop for now.
