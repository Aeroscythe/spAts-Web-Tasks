Another one? Well, yes. This is the Task specific Readme.

**Task:**

> Suppose you are a web developer working under the Director of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. You are asked by the MHRD office to submit a report of students who have startup ideas and wanting to start some business so that the MHRD can fund them under the Startup India Scheme. You have access to the Institute Website.
>
> Task Specs
>
> 1. Create a form portal where user can fill up their identity details(eg. name, branch, etc), Startup Ideas(startup idea, amount of funding expected, etc).
> 2. Use HTML and CSS and JS ( Use any of these according to your learnings)
> 3. Think of your own design and code.
> 4. Add images, or logos (startup India), etc according to your wish.
> 5. Upload on Github and explore how to host your website on Github.

So, going over all the stuff:

- [X] The HTML is done, might push some changes if I end up adding something.
- [ ] The styling is kind of meh, will work on that further. I don't plan to make it excessive since well, the task asks for a formal form.
- [ ] There is no backend yet, the form doesn't actually do anything.
